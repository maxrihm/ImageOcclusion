## Memorize Application
### Description
The Memorize Application is designed for learning and remembering information through the use of flashcards. The application randomly selects a file from a designated folder and displays the information within the file. This is useful for studying before an exam or for learning information quickly.

### Usage
To use the Memorize Application, first, create a folder containing the text files you wish to study. The text files should be formatted with the information you want to learn, such as a question and answer format. The application will randomly select one of these files and display the information within it.

The application also requires a path to a folder containing any images you wish to use within your text files. Be sure to specify the correct path in the `FilesPool.cs` file.

To add new files, simply place the text file into the designated folder. The next time the application is run, the new file will be included in the random selection.
